To use the tutorials:
- Fork the repo or download the notebooks locally
- Create an environment locally from ATOC_4500_env.txt with the following command: <br>
  `$ conda create --name <ATOC_4500_Python_env> --file ATOC_4500_env.txt`
- Once you have created the environment for the first time you can now use the following commands to start up Jupyter Lab: <br>
  `$ conda activate /opt/anaconda3/envs/ATOC_4500_Python_env` #you may have a different path <br>
  `$ jupyter lab`
